Sums Problem

Given an array of integers, return the smallest set of indices of numbers such that they add up to a target number. You may not use the same element twice.

 

Examples:

 

[1,2,6,3,17,82,23,234] -> 26

Solution [3,6]

 

[1,2,6,3,17,82,23,234] -> 40

Solution [4,6]

 

[1,2,6,3,17,82,23,234] -> 23

Solution [6]

 

This is not your standard coding kata. You are expected to:

·       Complete the task in a single class/function

·       Solve from first principles

·       It needs to be human legible i.e. this is not a challenge to solve in the least amount of code/characters possible

·       Write down all assumptions and limits that you have made (they have not been provided for a reason)

·       Note down the methodology(ies) used to solve the problem

·       You can submit more than 1 solution – one naïve and one more elaborate as a possibility

·       You can use Java, Kotlin, C#, Javascript, Ruby, Python, C/C++, Clojure
